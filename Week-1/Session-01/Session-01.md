## Question-01: What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?

**Answer-01:** Protocol Stack is a collection of communication protocols that work together to enable network communication between different devices or systems.

In web development, the most commonly used protocol is the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). The TCP is used to facilitate communication between web servers and clients over the internet.
When a client makes a request to a web server, the request is sent using the HTTP protocol which runs on top of TCP. It processes a request and sends a response back to client using the same protocol.

There are many different protocols. Each protocol operates at a different layer, with particular functionality on top of the layer.
The layers of Internet protocols are often visualized in a diagram like this:

This diagram is by no means complete. There are many more protocols in the Internet protocol suite—especially at the application layer — such as SMTP for sending email and FTP for uploading files.

## Question-02: What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?

**Answer-02:** Currently, there are several types of web servers available. Few of them are -

1. **Application servers:** Application server is a server which is used to host the application. Application server are system software upon which web application or desktop applications run. It consists of web server connector, computer programming language, database connector, runtime libraries and the Administration code. Application server frameworks are Software framework for building application server. It allows users to create both web application and server environment.
2. **Client servers:** Client server is a distributed application that partition task or workload between the providers of resource or service called servers and service requesters are called as client Both clients and server communicate with each other over computer network on separate software hardware, but both client and server by reside in the system. Client does not share any of its resources but request resources from server.
3. **Mail Servers:** Mail server is server that handles and delivers email over a network, usually over the internet. It receives email from client computers and deliver them to other mail server. It also delivers email to client computers. Client computer is normal computer where user read their emails for examples computer at home or office. Also advanced mobile or smartphones with email facilities are considered client computers.
4. **FTP Servers:** FTP server is used for transferring files supporting sub directories, log in and set of manipulation commands. It can also be used to upload HTML pages on HTTP server or download log files to remote PC. Access control interface allows users to start or stop FTP server and to manage the built-in user accounts. It uses user callback function to send the notification about FTP server to user application.
5. **Real Time Communication Server:** Real time communication server is also known as chat server or IRC server. It refers to instant messaging servers. Real time communication server allows large number of users to exchange the information near instantaneously. For example, call over mobile phone or landline, instant messaging like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Live tv news, video calls, etc.
6. **Open Source Servers:** Open source server is a public domain software designed to deliver web pages over www. It runs on computers that is connected to the internet. Open source servers support file uploading and downloading using FTP, provides security features. It also supports other communication protocols.
7. **Web Server:** Web server is a computer software and underlying hardware that Accept request through HTTP. HTTP is a network protocol which is used to distribute the web pages. Using HTTP web browser send request to the server and initiate the communication. Then web server responds with the resources or content or error message. web server also accepts and store the resources sent from the user agent.
8. **Cloud Servers:** Virtual server is a server that is located in an offsite data center and its resources are shared by multiple users who have control over it. In other words, we can say that virtual server converts one physical server into multiple virtual machine where each can run their operating systems. Virtual servers are a more efficient use of power and can increase a server’s utilization from the typical 15 percent to as much as 80 percent. They are used for variety of applications from remote file access to web design and development.

## Question-03: What is web hosting, and what are the different types of hosting services available for websites?

**Answer-03:** Web hosting is a service that allows organizations and individuals to make their web applications accessible on the internet. Web hosting providers offer storage space on servers and provide the necessary infrastructure and services to ensure that web applications can be accessed by visitors around the world.

There are several types of hosting services available, with their own features and benefits, here are some most common types:

1. **Shared hosting:** Shared hosting involves multiple websites sharing the same server and resources. This is the most affordable option and is well-suited for small businesses and individuals who are just starting out.
2. **Virtual private server (VPS) hosting:** VPS hosting involves a single physical server being partitioned into multiple virtual servers, each with its own operating system, storage space, and resources. This is a good option for websites that require more resources and control than shared hosting can provide, but are not yet ready for a dedicated server.
3. **Dedicated hosting:** Dedicated hosting involves a single physical server being dedicated to a single website or organization. This provides the highest level of control and customization, and is best suited for websites with high traffic volumes or complex applications.
4. **Cloud hosting:** Cloud hosting involves multiple servers working together to host a website or application. This provides high scalability, flexibility, and reliability, as resources can be added or removed as needed.
5. **Managed hosting:** Managed hosting involves a hosting provider managing and maintaining the server infrastructure and software on behalf of the website owner. This is a good option for businesses or individuals who do not have the technical expertise to manage their own server.

## Question-04: What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?

**Answer-03:** Scaling refers to the process of increasing the capacity of a system to handle larger amounts of traffic, users, or data. In the context of web applications, scaling is important because as a website or application grows in popularity and usage, it may experience unexpectedly high traffic, which can lead to slow response times, errors, and downtime.

We can achieve scaling through **two** main approaches: vertical scaling and horizontal scaling.

1. **Vertical Scaling:** Vertical scaling involves increasing the capacity of a single server by adding more resources such as RAM, CPU, or storage. This approach is relatively straightforward and can be done quickly, but it is limited by the physical constraints of the server hardware. Vertical scaling is typically used for small to medium-sized applications that experience occasional spikes in traffic.
2. **Horizontal Scaling:** Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers to distribute the load and increase the capacity of the system. This approach requires more planning and coordination but allows for greater scalability and redundancy. Horizontal scaling is typically used for large-scale applications with high and consistent traffic volumes.

Both, vertical scaling and horizontal scaling are important for web applications, as they enable the application to handle traffic spikes, scale resources to meet demand, and improve overall reliability and performance.
